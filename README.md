# REST_API_PROJECT
A project to develop a working REST API which hosts Twitter JSON data and creating a client end webpage to read the information from the API

RUN ```npm install``` to install the modules and ```npm start``` to host repository

Visit local IP ```http://127.0.0.1:8080/proj/get_first_names``` and look at the information extracted.

Built this to test out REST API and was able to extract information.

Working to continue and add more information about how to extract unique pieces of information
